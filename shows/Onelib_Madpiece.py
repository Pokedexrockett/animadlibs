    madlib = f"My name is Monkey D. Luffy. And I’m the man who will become King Of The Pirates! With the straw hat entrusted to me by the great pirate Shanks, \
    I’m going to gather a mighty crew and head out to the grand line in search of the One Piece. \
    Gol D. Roger, the original King Of The Pirates conquered the Grand Line and found the legendary treasure himself. His death marked the start of the great pirate era we live in today. \
    There are many fierce pirates on the Grand Line so my crew and I will need to be strong. I have faith in us though. With their help and the power of my Gum-Gum fruit, \
    I know we will succeed! Onward!"\
